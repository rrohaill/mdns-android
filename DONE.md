The project has been successfully implemented as per the requirements. Both the broadcaster and receiver applications are fully functional and ready for use. Hilt has been added for dependency injection. To run the applications, open the project in Android Studio and run the broadcaster and receiver modules on two separate devices connected to the same network. The broadcaster will start advertising the service, and the receiver will discover and display it, allowing for seamless interaction between the two.
